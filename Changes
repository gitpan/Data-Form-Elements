Revision history for Data-Form-Elements

0.60    July 11 2004/9:00 PM
        Added better compatibility with CGI and Apache::Request style param()
        calls.  Made some real test files.  Fixed the CPAN.pm problem.  
        Added accessor shortcuts, so you can call $form->email to get or set
        the value of the "email" parameter.

0.51    July 6, 2004/4:00 PM (more or less)
        Made a clean distribution that WAS accepted by PAUSE (unlike 0.50).
        Forgot to use Module::Build::Compat, though, so CPAN.pm users were
        out of luck.  Sorry! 

0.50    July 6, 2004/1:16 PM
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
