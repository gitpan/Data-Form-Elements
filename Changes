        Finally sat down to look at the test failures coming from the cpan testers.  
        I'm not sure if anyone uses this or not, but at least the tests don't give 
        spurious failures any more.

        Added better compatibility with CGI and Apache::Request style param()
        calls.  Made some real test files.  Fixed the CPAN.pm problem.  
        Added accessor shortcuts, so you can call $form->email to get or set
        the value of the "email" parameter.

        Made a clean distribution that WAS accepted by PAUSE (unlike 0.50).
        Forgot to use Module::Build::Compat, though, so CPAN.pm users were
        out of luck.  Sorry!

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
